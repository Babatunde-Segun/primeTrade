          <p className={classes.privacyP}>
            We value your enthusiasm and interest in our cryptocurrency
            investment firm. To uphold efficiency and productivity, we prefer
            that all communication with our brokers occurs through text
            messages, preferably via messenger, rather than phone calls.
            <br /> <br />
            This approach ensures thorough documentation of conversations and
            enables our brokers to concentrate on their responsibilities without
            interruptions. Here are four reasons behind our preference for this
            mode of communication:

            <h3 className={classes.privacyH3}>5.1. Efficiency:</h3>
            <p className={classes.privacyP}>
              Utilizing text messages, preferably through messenger, facilitates
              swift and concise communication. This approach empowers our
              brokers to promptly and efficiently address inquiries.

          <div className={classes.privacyFlexContainer}>
            <h3 className={classes.privacyH3}>5.2. Efficiency:</h3>
            <p className={classes.privacyP}>
              Using text messages (preferably messenger) enables swift and clear
              communication, enabling our brokers to promptly and efficiently
              address inquiries.

          <div className={classes.privacyFlexContainer}>
            <h3 className={classes.privacyH3}>5.3. Productivity:</h3>
            <p className={classes.privacyP}>
              Reducing phone calls minimizes interruptions, granting our brokers
              more time to focus on researching, analyzing, and managing
              investments for our clients.
            </p>

            <h3 className={classes.privacyH3}>5.4.Security:</h3>
            <p className={classes.privacyP}>
              Utilizing written communication through text messages provides a
              secure and encrypted channel for exchanging sensitive information,
              ensuring confidentiality, and safeguarding the interests of our
              clients. <br /> <br />
              -Please be aware that prior to attaining full verification status,
              brokers must undergo a procedural step involving the acceptance of
              broker terms of use, which includes the condition of refraining
              from contacting investors via phone calls.
              <br /> <br />
              -Furthermore, the brokerage firm currently has and will maintain
              the authority to monitor communications between brokers and
              investors to ensure operational efficiency.
              <br /> <br />
              -Moreover, while monitoring telephone conversations between
              investors and brokers presents challenges, monitoring text-based
              interactions remains feasible and straightforward.
              <br /> <br />
              -We've also restricted in-person meetings between brokers and
              investors, as our company won't assume liability for any outcomes
              from such meetings. Just to emphasize, we exclusively maintain
              detailed records of text messages (preferably through messenger)
              exchanged between brokers and investors. This ensures efficient
              customer service whenever necessary.
              <br /> <br />
              Moreover, any broker found to be non-compliant with the terms
              outlined by our company will face appropriate sanctions.
              Non-compliance may result in the revocation of the broker's
              trading license.
              <br /> <br />
              -Thank you for your cooperation in following this communication
              protocol. If you have any additional questions or need assistance,
              please feel free to contact us via our Customer Support live chat.
